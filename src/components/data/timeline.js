      "After finishing at Penn State, I took a much needed break from academic work and began to explore more in depth development topics and tools that had been absent from my education. Through this time, I followed tutorials online and created self-guided projects to demonstrate some of my knowledge and skills.",

    duration: "1.5 years",
    details:
      "I was invited back to work at the same company as a software development intern. I worked part-time through my second and third years of college. Also, this time ranged from the beginning through the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. During my time, I brought projects from white paper, to prototype, to production level deployment. I performed platform improvements and bug fixes on various client facing as well as internal facing parts of the codebase. Additionally, I began development on a new integration of analytics and SEO software. My favorite project was improving the performance of an internal tool that most of the company used multiple times daily. By the time I finished my changes, the load time had been reduced by 90%. Development was mainly completed in C# using the .NET framework along with JQuery, SQL, web-based API's, PowerShell, and test driven development. I also utilized git, an issue tracking software called Jira, and communication tools to collaborate with and report to co-workers.",

      "I began working at a leading website provider for tire and automotive shops. My work during this time was mainly focused on finding and reporting bugs and issues during a client side platform update. Due to a wide variety of clients, each client site behaved quite differently and resulted in many unique bugs, as well as a number of wide reaching issues. During my time, I used a virtual machine for testing, along with Git, and the issue tracking software, Jira.",

      "I wrote my first line(s) of code in my junior year of high school in an introduction to computer science class. I really enjoyed the instant gratification of programming and building something useful out of nothing. I continued my journey the next year in an AP Computer Science class. Both of these classes focused on Java based programming. I enjoyed my time in these classes enough that I decided to pursue a degree in computer science.",
